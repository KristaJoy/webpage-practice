  They grow up so fast.... Last June, in a year when smiles were in big demand, Mei Mei the red panda surprised Oregon Zoo fans by giving birth to a tiny cub.
  <br>
  <br>

Red panda cubs are born blind, their eyes only opening after a few weeks, and they don't leave their maternity den for a few months. But Pabu, as the cub was named, proved quite a handful once he emerged. Nicknamed the "Prince of Pounce," the young red panda earned a reputation for surprising Mei Mei with playful ambushes.

<br>

Now a handsome — and still somewhat rambunctious — young adult, Pabu will soon be moving with Mei Mei to a new home at ZooMontana in Billings. The pair is expected to depart for "big sky country" in early March. The last day to see them at the Oregon Zoo will be Sunday, March 7.

"It's been so much fun to watch Pabu grow, and to see the way Mei Mei has taken care of him," keeper Sara Morgan said. "The timing for this is right, but we're really going to miss them."
